#Cam
This is a small script which acts as a cam for your page using hashes.

Usage--
If you have a web page which has to be monitored and you dont want to see any changes on the same then this script is for you.

Very much usable to make sure there is data Integrity.

If any changes occured on a particular page this will alert you immediatly.

if you want to change the link manually  just delete hash.txt  and run the script again.
